FITNESS TRACKER 

TO DO LIST: (BEFORE YOU TAKE ANOTHER STEP LOAD YOUR PROJECT PROGRESS TO GITHUB)

	1- Complete the "/build_profile" route. (Should create a fitnessProfile for the 
						 logged in User.)

	2- Create a dashboard page. (This page contains links to Workout Tree, Build 
				     exercise, and Progress Report.)

	3- Complete a simple Workout Tree page. (The front page of the Workout Tree will
						 have have links to all major exercise 
						 categories.) 

	4- Complete a simple "Customize Routine" process (Create your own or Auto-Gen.)



PROBLEMS: 

	1- Bcrypt's decode functionality in the /login route throws the "invalid salt" 
	   error. Figure out why it's not compatible with Django 2.1.2 and Python 3.6.1
